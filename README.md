# ESL Robot-Assisted Pedagogy

This repository contains Python scripts and HTML files designed to investigate the potential of robot-assisted pedagogy in English as a Second Language (ESL) education. The project encompasses three distinct learning scenarios:

1. Vocabulary acquisition through visual recognition of ArUco cards.
2. Action demonstration using ArUco cue cards to initiate specific robot movements.
3. Interactive ESL games powered by Python programming.

## Repository Contents

### Python Files:

- `scenario1.py`: This script supports the visual recognition of ArUco cards to facilitate vocabulary acquisition.
  
- `scenario2.py`: Uses ArUco cue cards to trigger specific robot movements for demonstrating actions.
  
- `scenario3.py`: A script to run interactive ESL games, providing an engaging experience for learners.

### HTML Files (for Scenario 3):

- `quiz.html`: The main interface for the ESL quiz game.
  
- `thankyou.html`: A thank-you page displayed after the completion of the quiz.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed. For instance:

- opencv-python
